# notification-application
Semi-functional application showcasing techniques with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a notification application between students and professors

All passwords and messages within the application are hardcoded

## Usage
Open index.html and in the Password textbox, you have the option to access the professor or student side of the application by simply typing "professor" or "student" (a username does not need to be entered)

Adding a class or creating a message in the application is non-functional since all information is hard-coded. In the student side of the application, selecting a checkbox (or more) and clicking the "Mark as Read" button will temporarily hide the notification, but the notification will show up again once the page is re-visited
